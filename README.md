### 1. 📨 Problem Statement
The current workforce classification data in India is outdated and fails to capture the latest trends. This study aims to:

* Update the classification of main and marginal workers by industry and demographics.
* Provide insights into workforce distribution across states and industry categories.
* Help policymakers and businesses make informed decisions.

### 2. 📅 Dataset Overview
 Source: State-wise CSV files containing counts of workers classified by sex, rural/urban distribution, etc.

### 3. 🔑 Technologies Used
  *  #### Data Manipulation and Analysis: 
      *  pandas, numpy
  *  #### Visualization:
      *  matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express
  *  #### NLP: 
      *  sklearn (TfidfVectorizer, KMeans)
  *  #### Dashboard Development:
      *  Streamlit, Plotly

### 4. 📈 Approach
#### Data Preparation:
  * Merged multiple state-wise datasets into a single dataframe.
  * Cleaned and standardized column names and entries.
    
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Identified workforce distribution by industry, state, sex, and geography.
  * Created visualizations for key insights.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
  * Clustered industries using TfidfVectorizer and KMeans.
  * Categorized industries into groups like Automobile Industries, Developmental works, Manufacturing, etc,.

#### Visualization Dashboard:
  * Created an interactive dashboard with Streamlit to visualize workforce data by geography and industry.

### 5. 🏢 Key Features
  *  #### EDA Insights:
      *  Workforce distribution by state, rural/urban demographics, and sex.
      *  Top industries with the highest worker populations.
        
  *  #### NLP Insights:
      *  Grouped industries into five meaningful clusters for better understanding.

  *  #### Interactive Dashboard:
      *  Visualize data dynamically across states and industries.
      *  Analyze trends with custom filters and interactive plots.

### 6. ✅ Results
  *  State-wise Workforce Distribution:
      *  West Bengal and Rajasthan have the highest worker populations.
  *  NLP Clustering:
      *  Industries grouped into categories like Heavy Industries, Organizational works, Health sector, Education, etc,.

### 7. 🚀 Future Improvements
  *  Include real-time workforce updates.
  *  Extend industry classification with deep learning techniques.
  *  Integrate advanced geospatial visualizations.
